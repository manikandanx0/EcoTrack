## üåç Hybrid Carbon Footprint Tracker ‚Äî Workflow

### **1. Data Ingestion**

-   **User Inputs (UI/Web form)**

    -   Commute: distance, mode of transport.
    -   Meals: type, frequency (veg/non-veg, packaged vs fresh).
    -   Home: electricity usage (kWh), LPG/other fuels.
    -   Shopping/Consumption: clothes, electronics, etc.
    -   Waste/Recycle habits.

-   **External APIs (optional, if time)**

    -   Weather/energy grid mix API ‚Üí cleaner vs coal power.
    -   Maps API ‚Üí commute distance.

---

### **2. Rule-Based Baseline (Fast MVP)**

-   Use **official emission factors** (from Grok JSON retrieval step).

    -   Example: Car (petrol): \~0.2 kg CO‚ÇÇ/km.
    -   Beef: \~27 kg CO‚ÇÇ/kg.

-   Rule-based calculator = `Sum(activity * factor)`
-   This ensures you always have a **working demo**, even if ML models lag.

---

### **3. ML Layer (Predictive/Adaptive Enhancement)**

-   **Why ML?**

    -   To refine factors where rules are too simplistic.
    -   To predict missing inputs (e.g., estimate kWh usage from appliance list).
    -   To personalize predictions (learn from user history).

-   **Examples of Dataset Usage**

    -   Transport dataset ‚Üí Train regression/classification to predict CO‚ÇÇ/km by vehicle type & occupancy.
    -   Food dataset ‚Üí Classify meals into impact levels, refine kg CO‚ÇÇ values.
    -   Energy dataset ‚Üí Predict household CO‚ÇÇ from features like region, house size, appliance use.
    -   Waste dataset ‚Üí Estimate emissions saved by recycling vs landfill.

---

### **4. Hybrid Integration**

-   **Step 1**: Run baseline **rule-based estimate** (always available).
-   **Step 2**: If ML model exists ‚Üí adjust/refine that factor.

    -   Example: Rule says: 8 kg CO‚ÇÇ for food ‚Üí ML refines to 7.3 kg given user‚Äôs cuisine pattern.

-   **Step 3**: Present both **‚ÄúBaseline vs Refined (AI)‚Äù** footprints in dashboard.

---

### **5. Visualization Layer (Web UI)**

-   Build in **Streamlit (fast) or React/Flask backend (flexible)**.
-   Dashboard shows:

    -   Daily carbon footprint (pie chart or stacked bar).
    -   Breakdown by factor: Transport, Food, Energy, Waste.
    -   Offset tips: tree planting, public transport alternatives, energy-saving tips.
    -   Trend line (if user logs multiple days).

---

### **6. Demo Flow (for Hackathon Pitch)**

1. User opens web app.
2. Inputs commute, food, energy, and shopping habits.
3. System instantly computes **rule-based CO‚ÇÇ footprint**.
4. ML module adjusts values (e.g., more precise commute factor).
5. UI shows:

    - **Baseline vs AI-refined footprint** (judges will like the comparison).
    - Suggestions to reduce/offset.

6. Export: small report (PDF/CSV).

---

### **7. Stretch Goals (if time permits)**

-   Gamify: ‚ÄúYour carbon score today = 62. Compete with friends.‚Äù
-   Personalization: Learn patterns ‚Üí send targeted recommendations.
-   Offsetting integration: API to buy credits or donate to NGOs.

---

‚ö° **Summary**:

-   Rule-based ensures reliability + quick MVP.
-   ML gives innovation + personalization.
-   Side-by-side comparison makes the hybrid approach clear for judges.
